# Customer Banking Project

This is a Python project designed to manage and calculate interest for savings and CD accounts. It prompts the user for input regarding account balances, interest rates, and the duration in months, then calculates the interest earned and updates the account balance accordingly.

# Features:
  - Savings Account: Users can input an initial balance, interest rate (APR), and months. The program calculates the interest earned and updates the savings account balance.
  - CD Account: Similar to the savings account, but it also handles Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts with specific rules on interest rates and balances.

# Project Structure:
  - customer_banking.py: Main program file that handles user inputs and calls functions to calculate interest for savings and CD accounts.
  - savings_account.py: Contains the create_savings_account function to calculate the savings account balance and interest.
  - cd_account.py: Contains the create_cd_account function to calculate the CD account balance and interest.
